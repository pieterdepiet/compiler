## Features:
- Integers with math
- Strings (very limited)
- Type safety
- Functions
    - Return values
    - Named parameters
    - Overloading
- If, else if, else and comparisons
- Some object orientation
- Intermediate representation, universal file format for half-compiled code
- Arrays, only local definition, can access and modify local array and pointers like argv
## In progress
- Arrays
