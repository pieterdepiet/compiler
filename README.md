Experimental project to learn assembly and other low-level stuff.

## Features:
- Integers
- Strings (very limited)
- Type safety
- Function definitions with return values and named arguments
- Function calls
- Integer addition/substraction
- If, else if, else and comparisons
- Limited object orientation
## In progress
- Implement all comparisons
