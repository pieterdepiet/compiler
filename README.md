# Compiler
Experimental project to learn assembly and other low-level stuff.

## Features:
- Integers
- Type safety (Currently there's only one type, that's ints but typesafety is already kind of there)
- Function definitions with return values and named arguments
- Function calls
- Integer addition
## TODO:
- [ ] Implement classes
- [ ] Add strings
- [ ] Add arrays
- [ ] More math
- [ ] More number types
